什麼是晨間隨筆？簡單的說，晨間隨筆就是三頁手稿，是完完全全的意識流。「哦，天哪，又是早上，我沒有東西好寫，我需要洗窗簾。昨天去乾洗店拿衣服了嗎？⋯⋯」講得難聽點，這就是腦海汙水管，而這正是它的一項重要功能。
What are morning pages? Put simply, the morning pages are three pages of longhand writing, strictly stream-of-consciousness: “Oh, god, another morning. I have NOTHING to say. I need to wash the curtains. Did I get my laundry yesterday? Blah, blah, blah ...” They might also, more ingloriously, be called _brain drain,_since that is one of their main functions.


**晨間隨筆愛怎麼寫就怎麼寫。** 這種晨間隨筆不是藝術品，也算不上是寫作。對於使用這本書但不想成為作家的讀者，我要特別強調這一點。寫作只不過是種工具，隨筆就是在紙上隨手記下腦子裡隨時想到的東西，不論事情多小、多傻、太多、多怪，都值得記下來。
_There is no wrong way to do morning pages._ These daily morning meanderings are not meant to be _art._ Or even _writing._ I stress that point to reassure the nonwriters working with this book. Writing is simply one of the tools. Pages arc meant to be, simply, the act of moving the hand across the page and writing down _whatever_ comes to mind. Nothing is too petty, too silly, too stupid, or too weird to be included.

晨間隨筆不是用來耍聰明的，但偶爾會有聰明之作，不過大多數通常沒什麼看頭，除了你，不會有其他人知道。除了你，沒有人可以看你的晨間隨筆；甚至剛開始的八個禮拜，連你自己都不該看。只管寫下三張紙塞進紙袋，或在活頁筆記本上寫個三頁，不要翻回去，就是寫三張紙⋯⋯第二天再寫三頁。
The morning pages are not supposed to sound smart—although sometimes they might. Most times they won’t, and nobody will ever know except you. Nobody is allowed to read your morning pages except you. And you shouldn’t even read them yourself for the first eight weeks or so. Just write three pages, and stick them into an envelope. Or write three pages in a spiral notebook and don’t leaf back through. _Justwrite three pages_ ... and write three more pages the next day.

晨間隨筆偶爾會多彩多姿，但往往是負面的，經常是東拉西扯、自怨自艾、了無新意、誇張或幼稚、憤怒或乏味，甚至看起來傻氣。很好！
Although occasionally colorful, the morning pages arc often negative, frequently fragmented, often self-pitying, repetitive, stilted or babyish, angry or bland—even silly sounding. Good!

晨間隨筆裡的怒氣、牢騷、瑣事，就是橫梗在你和創造力之間的障礙。擔心工作、擔心衣服沒洗、擔心車子的怪聲、擔心情人奇怪的眼神，這些事在我們的潛意識中打轉，使我們過得渾渾噩噩。把這些寫下來。
All that angry, whiny, petty stuff that you write down in the morning stands between you and your creativity. Worrying about the job, the laundry, the funny knock in the car, the weird look in your lover’s eye—this stuff eddies through our subconscious and muddies our days. Get it on the page.

**晨間隨筆是恢復創造力的頭號工具。** 我們和靈感受挫的藝術家一樣，批評自己時毫不留情。即使我們在外人眼中已是很好的藝術家，但我們永遠覺得自己做得不夠多、不夠好。我們受到本身內在完美主義者的迫害，這名常駐在（左）腦裡的烏鴉嘴是個可惡的內在批評家，不斷假真話之名而發出惡劣的評語。烏鴉嘴說的好話有：「這東西也能叫寫作？笑話！你連標點符號都不會用。到現在還闖不出一番成績，你沒指望了。你連字都不會寫，憑什麼認為自己有創意？」沒完沒了。
**The morning pages are the primary tool of creative recovery.**  As blocked artists, we tend to criticize ourselves mercilessly. Even if we look like functioning artists to the world, we feel we never do enough and what we do isn’t right. We are victims of our own internalized perfectionist, a nasty internal and eternal critic, the Censor, who resides in our (left) brain and keeps up a constant stream of subversive remarks that are often disguised as the truth. The Censor says wonderful things like: “You call that writing? What a joke. You can’t even punctuate. If you haven’t done it by now you never will. You can’t even spell. What makes you think you can be creative?” And on and on.

訂個規矩：切記，烏鴉嘴的負面意見未必是事實。多練習，每天早上一起床就開始寫，你將學會迴避判官。晨間隨筆沒有好壞可言，所以烏鴉嘴的意見不重要。就讓烏鴉嘴一直碎碎念下去（一定會），你的手只管在紙上移動。如果想記下烏鴉嘴的想法，儘量寫。注意看烏鴉嘴多愛對準你的創意罩門。不要搞錯：判官要對付的人是你。這個敵人很狡滑，你愈聰明，它也跟著變聰明。你寫了個好劇本？烏鴉嘴會告訴你，你的能耐不過如此。你畫出了第一幅素描？判官說：「這又不是畢卡索的作品。」
Make this a rule: always remember that your Censor’s negative opinions are not the truth. This takes practice. By spilling out of bed and straight onto the page every morning, you learn to evade the Censor. Because there is no wrong way to write the morning pages, the Censor’s opinion doesn’t count. Let your Censor rattle on. (And it will.) Just keep your hand moving across the page. Write down the Censor’s thoughts if you want to. Note how it loves to aim for your creative jugular. Make no mistake: the Censor is out to get you. It’s a cunning foe. Every time you get smarter, so does it. So you wrote one good play? The Censor tells you that’s all there is. So you drew your first sketch? The Censor says, “It’s not Picasso.”

把烏鴉嘴想像成是卡通裡的毒蛇，在你的創意伊甸園裡爬來爬去，嘶嘶地發出惡毒的話語使你卸下心防。如果你不喜歡毒蛇，也可以替你的烏鴉嘴找個好的卡通形象，例如大白鯊裡的鯊魚，畫上個大叉叉，貼在你寫作的地方或是筆記本封面內頁。把烏鴉嘴變成討厭又聰明的小角色，準備對你和你的創造力使展力量。
Think of your Censor as a cartoon serpent, slithering around your creative Eden, hissing vile things to keep you off guard. If a serpent doesn’t appeal to you, you might want to find a good cartoon image of your Censor, maybe the shark from *Jaws*, and put an *X* through it. Post it where you tend to write or on the inside cover of your notebook. Just making the Censor into the nasty, clever little character that it is begins to pry loose some of its power over you and your creativity.

許多學員會貼上父母醜陋的照片當做烏鴉嘴，因為他們心中的烏鴉嘴是父母扎下的根。重要的是，不要把烏鴉嘴的話當成理性的聲音，而要聽出其中的破壞力。晨間隨筆會幫助你做到這點。
More than one student has tacked up an unflattering picture of the parent responsible for the Censor’s installation in his or her psyche and called that his or her Censor. The point is to stop taking the Censor as the voice of reason and learn to hear it for the blocking device that it is. Morning pages will help you to do this.

**晨間隨筆不能討價還價。** 絕對不能一天不寫或者敷衍了事。不要管心情好不好，也不管烏鴉嘴的話有多難聽。我們以為心情好才能寫作，沒這回事。
**Morning pages are nonnegotiable.** Never skip or skimp on morning pages. Your mood doesn’t matter. The rotten thing your Censor says doesn’t matter. We have this idea that we need to be in the mood to write. We don’t.

晨間隨筆讓你學到，心情好壞不重要。有些日子你覺得自己的作品全是垃圾，然而最好的創意作品反而在這種時候出現。晨間隨筆要教你：不要批判，寫就是了。你累了，心情惡劣，精神不集中，背負著壓力，有什麼大不了！內心的藝術家是名幼兒，需要食物。晨間隨筆會餵養你的小小藝術家，所以寫下你的晨間隨筆吧！
Morning pages will teach you that your mood doesn’t really matter. Some of the best creative work gets done on the days when you feel that everything you’re doing is just plain junk. The morning pages will teach you to stop judging and just let yourself write. So what if you’re tired, crabby, distracted, stressed? Your artist is a child and it needs to be fed. Morning pages feed your artist child. So write your morning pages.

寫下三頁腦海裡想得到的任何東西，就這麼簡單。如果想不到東西好寫，就寫：「我想不到東西好寫⋯⋯」就這樣寫滿三頁。不管寫什麼，就是寫滿三頁為止。
Three pages of whatever crosses your mind—that’s all there is to it. If you can’t think of anything to write, then write, “I can’t think of anything to write....” Do this until you have filled three pages. *Do anything until you have filled three pages.*

有人會問：「為什麼要寫晨間隨筆？」我開玩笑說：**「為了要翻開新的一頁。」** 大家以為這是在說笑，但我絕不是開玩笑，晨間隨筆確實會讓我們翻開新的一頁：翻過恐懼、否定、情緒到另一頁。最重要的是，我們要擺脫判官，擺脫烏鴉嘴的嘮叨，才能找到自己安靜的中心點，在此聽見造物者和本身造物者沉靜又細微的聲音。
When people ask, “Why do we write morning pages?” I joke, “To get to the other side.” They think I am kidding, but I’m not. Morning pages do get us to the other side: the other side of our fear, of our negativity, of our moods. Above all, they get us beyond our Censor. Beyond the reach of the Censor’s babble we find our own quiet center, the place where we hear the still, small voice that is at once our creator’s and our own.


把晨間隨筆當成冥想，可能會有幫助。也許這不是你習慣的冥想方式，或者你根本沒冥想的習慣。隨筆或許看起來不夠靈性，甚至不像沉思，實際上更像負面和俗氣的東西，但這是有效的冥想形式，帶給我們洞察力，幫助我們改變生命。
It may be useful for you to think of the morning pages as meditation. It may not be the practice of meditation you are accustomed to. You may, in fact, not be accustomed to meditating at all. The pages may not seem spiritual or even meditative—more like negative and materialistic, actually—but they are a valid form of meditation that gives us insight and helps us effect change in our lives.

先看看冥想有什麼好處。冥想有很多種說法。科學家認為冥想是左右腦和轉換技巧，從理性腦轉移到藝術腦，從快到慢，從淺到深。為企業做健診的管理顧問，把冥想視為解決壓力的技巧；追求靈性的人將此過程視為是走向神的路徑；藝術家和創意專家贊許這能引領出更有創見的洞察力。
Let’s take a look at what we stand to gain by meditating. There are many ways of thinking about meditation. Scientists speak of it in terms of brain hemispheres and shunting techniques. We move from logic brain to artist brain and from fast to slow, shallow to deep. Management consultants, in pursuit of corporate physical health, have learned to think of meditation primarily as a stress-management technique. Spiritual seekers choose to view the process as a gateway to God. Artists and creativity mavens approve of it as a conduit for higher creative insights.

冥想是為了發現自己真正的身分，在宇宙運行中的正確位置。透過冥想，我們和內在的力量根源有了連結，也終於承認這項連結；內在力量能轉化我們的外在世界。換句話說，冥想不僅帶來智慧的光，也帶來全面改變的力量。
We meditate to discover our own identity, our right place in the scheme of the universe. Through meditation, we acquire and eventually acknowledge our connection to an inner power source that has the ability to transform our outer world. In other words, meditation gives us not only the light of insight but also the power for expansive change.

洞見和其本身是一種智識上的撫慰。力量和力量本身是股盲目的力道，容易聚集，也容易毀滅。只有當有意識地學習連結力與光時，我們才能感受到自己身為創意生物的真正身分，而晨間隨筆讓我們鑄造出這個環節，提供心靈無線火腿族的設備，與內在造物者相聯繫。由此看來，晨間隨筆可算是一種靈修。
Insight in and of itself is an intellectual comfort. Power in and of itself is a blind force that can destroy as easily as build. It is only when we consciously learn to link power and light that we begin to feel our rightful identities as creative beings. The morning pages allow us to forge this link. They provide us with a spiritual ham-radio set to contact the Creator Within. For this reason, the morning pages are a spiritual practice.

如果寫著寫著還觸及不到意外的內在力量，晨間隨筆便不可能一直寫下去。我寫了很多年才領悟到，**隨筆是通往強烈、清晰自我感受的道路**，我們循著這條路走進內心，在此和自己的創造力、造物者相遇。
It is impossible to write morning pages for any extended period of time without coming into contact with an unexpected inner power. Although I used them for many years before I realized this, **the pages are a pathway to a strong and clear sense of self**, They are a trail that we follow into our own interior, where we meet both our own creativity and our creator.

晨間隨筆描繪出內心的地圖。沒有地圖，夢想只是不詳地域，這是我的親身體驗。大幅度的改變需要內省的光芒和力量。要一天又一天、一個月又一個月地抱怨，而不採取建設性的行動，是很困難的事。隨筆帶我們走出絕望，走向出乎夢想之外的解答。
Morning pages map our own interior. Without them, our dreams may remain terra incognita. I know mine did. Using them, the light of insight is coupled with the power for expansive change. It is very difficult to complain about a situation morning after morning, month after month, without being moved to constructive action. The pages lead us out of despair and into undreamed-of solutions.
